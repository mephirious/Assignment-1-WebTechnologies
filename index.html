                    <p>Since Bennington’s death, Mike Shinoda has released the solo albums Post Traumatic and Dropped Frames. In a statement, he shared:</p>
                    <blockquote> Before LINKIN PARK, our first band name was Xero. This album title refers to both this humble beginning and the journey we’re currently undertaking. Sonically and emotionally, it is about past, present, and future—embracing our signature sound, but new and full of life. It was made with a deep appreciation for our new and longtime bandmates, our friends, our family, and our fans. We are proud of what LINKIN PARK has become over the years, and excited about the journey ahead.</blockquote>

                    <p>Rakim Athelaston Mayers (named after “The God MC” Rakim), better known by his stage name, A$AP Rocky, hails from Harlem, New York. He is no stranger to the cliché rap lifestyle, popularized by fellow Harlem Patriarchs, from Big L and Kool Moe Dee to Mase and Cam'ron. However, Rocky’s melodic rap style has drawn more immediate comparisons to recently incarcerated Harlemite Max B.</p>
                    <p>Rocky’s career began in 2007, when he joined the Harlem-based A$AP Mob, founded by A$AP Yams, A$AP Bari and A$AP Illz. Rocky was projected into fame in 2011 following the release of his debut mixtape LIVE.LOVE.A$AP, which featured hits like “Peso” and “Purple Swag,” and earned him a record deal with RCA Records.</p>
