                    <blockquote> Before LINKIN PARK, our first band name was Xero. This album title refers to both this humble beginning and the journey we’re currently undertaking. Sonically and emotionally, it is about past, present, and future—embracing our signature sound, but new and full of life. It was made with a deep appreciation for our new and longtime bandmates, our friends, our family, and our fans. We are proud of what LINKIN PARK has become over the years, and excited about the journey ahead.</blockquote>

                <h3>A$AP Rocky</h3>

                <div>
                    <h4>About artist</h4>
                    <p>Rakim Athelaston Mayers (named after “The God MC” Rakim), better known by his stage name, A$AP Rocky, hails from Harlem, New York. He is no stranger to the cliché rap lifestyle, popularized by fellow Harlem Patriarchs, from Big L and Kool Moe Dee to Mase and Cam'ron. However, Rocky’s melodic rap style has drawn more immediate comparisons to recently incarcerated Harlemite Max B.</p>
                    <p>Rocky’s career began in 2007, when he joined the Harlem-based A$AP Mob, founded by A$AP Yams, A$AP Bari and A$AP Illz. Rocky was projected into fame in 2011 following the release of his debut mixtape LIVE.LOVE.A$AP, which featured hits like “Peso” and “Purple Swag,” and earned him a record deal with RCA Records.</p>
                    <p>His debut studio album, Long. Live. A$AP was released in 2013, after several pushbacks by his label. Long.Live.A$AP was thought to exceed the promises of his debut mixtape, preserving Rocky’s immaculate taste while smartly upgrading his sound.</p>
                    <p>After month’s of teasing projects, one of which included a completely experimental instrumental album, Rocky returned with the Juicy J aided track “Multiply” in 2014, as well as “Lord Pretty Flacko Joyde” on New Year’s 2015. Both of these tracks served as promotional singles for Flacko next record, AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP. Before the album’s release however, long-time friend and mentor A$AP Yams passed due to an overdose, which left a huge mark on Rakim ever since. The album was released on May 26th 2015, following a leak one week prior to its initial release date. Upon its release, AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP received generally positive to mixed reviews from music critics, including praises for the psychedelic anthem “L$D”.</p>
                    <p>After a brief hiatus from solo music, and an increasing indulgence into fashion and art, Rocky announced that he was working on an upcoming studio album entitled TESTING. On May 25, 2018, the album was released and was met with mixed reviews, primarily due to the album being Rocky’s most experimental project yet.</p>
                    <p>Flacko’s music can be characterised by its lucid and cloud-like feeling, though Rocky never hesitates to drop bars when he needs to. It is also thought that Rocky has some of the best music videos in the game.</p>
                    <p>However, being a staple in new-school hip-hop, Rocky’s success and accolades aren’t limited to music. He’s widely acclaimed for his impeccable fashion sense, and was named one of the most influential names in fashion of 2017. He was even featured on the cover of a 2017 issue of GQ magazine, and labeled as the “World’s Flyest Human.” He also established his own creative collective/record label AWGE in the same year.</p>

                    <h4>About artist</h4>
                    <p>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper and songwriter from Compton, California.</p>
                    <p>He first gained major attention after the release of his 2010 mixtape O(verly) D(edicated). In 2011, his album Section.80, released exclusively through iTunes, instantly ranked as one of the top digital hip-hop releases of the year. In 2012, he crossed over to mainstream audiences with his major label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, which was widely regarded as an instant classic. In 2015, he released To Pimp a Butterfly to widespread acclaim. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart. The following year, untitled unmastered. was released by surprise. In April of 2017, Kendrick released DAMN. on Good Friday. After five years of silence, on May 13, 2022, Kendrick released his fifth studio album, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers.</p>
                    <p>Known for his storytelling, imagery, wordplay, passion and varied song structures, Kendrick brings hard-hitting lyricism with narratives to the West Coast, not traditionally known for its lyricists.</p>
                    <p>Kendrick Lamar’s position within the rap game is held incredibly high. Lamar was ranked at No. 2 on Billboard’s 10 Best Rappers of All Time list, alongside artists like Jay-Z, Nas, Notorious B.I.G. and more. He has also been nominated for 47 Grammy Awards and has won 17 of them; with three for Best Rap Album. He is also the only rapper to win all of the Grammy Awards in the rap field at the same ceremony, doing so in 2016 and 2018.</p>
                    <p>Lamar is a member of the hip-hop collective Black Hippy, along with Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul—all of whom came up together as a part of Top Dawg Entertainment; however, in 2022, it was announced that Kendrick would be departing TDE following the release of his fifth studio album. He is also signed to Dr. Dre’s Aftermath Entertainment imprint, under Interscope Records.</p>
                    <p>In February of 2018, Kendrick and TDE released Black Panther: The Album (Music from and Inspired by). It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. In April, later the same year, he won the Pulitzer Prize in music for his album, DAMN.</p>
                    <p>Several years of relative inactivity followed, with Kendrick only resurfacing for features or collaborative efforts. In March of 2020, Lamar and Dave Free launched PgLang, a production company whose name stands for “program language.” In August 2021, Kendrick launched a new website, where he proceeded to announce the release date for his next project in April of 2022. Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers appeared on Friday, May 13, as promised—a double album five years in the making.</p>
